How do I hide the login link/button in the menu in webflow on those embedded Knack pages (which will show “logout” in the embedded view when the user is logged in)?
Thanks","Help needed.
I would like to setup my portfolio with CMS however I need to ad more images to different pages projects. When setting up it seems that every page has to be exactly the same and if i ad elements to one page it adds to all.
Some of my projects only have a few images while others have a lot.
If someone could point me in the right direction here that would be most appreciated!

I’m trying to push form file data to Airtable via Integromat but I couldn’t make it so far.
The problem is Webflow creates an API link for form files and it doesn’t allow somebody to reach that file without login.
I tried to HTTP request for OUTH but I couldn’t make it either. Is there anybody who has faced a similar issue?
I just want to create a job application form and push the CV file to the client’s email.
Thanks,
Batuhan","Hi,
I’m having major page-trigger interaction lag on all of my pages; after loading, interaction run smoothly. I don’t have plug-ins or heavy assets running on load; all images are compressed using tiny png.
If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it. It’s sucks because the interactions used to load smooth  and not sure what changed.
Thank you,
Amir
