title_tag,Hide login in menu when logged in on external site embedded in Webflow,Different Portfolio Pages
content,"I have created some user pages requiring logging in on www.knack.com and can embed those pages into my webflow site.
How do I hide the login link/button in the menu in webflow on those embedded Knack pages (which will show “logout” in the embedded view when the user is logged in)?
Thanks","Help needed.
I would like to setup my portfolio with CMS however I need to ad more images to different pages projects. When setting up it seems that every page has to be exactly the same and if i ad elements to one page it adds to all.
Some of my projects only have a few images while others have a lot.
If someone could point me in the right direction here that would be most appreciated!
