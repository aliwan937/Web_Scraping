title_tag,Hide login in menu when logged in on external site embedded in Webflow
content,"I have created some user pages requiring logging in on www.knack.com and can embed those pages into my webflow site.
How do I hide the login link/button in the menu in webflow on those embedded Knack pages (which will show “logout” in the embedded view when the user is logged in)?
Thanks"
