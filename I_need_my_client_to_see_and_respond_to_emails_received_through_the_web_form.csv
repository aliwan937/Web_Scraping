I do have my own hosting, and already have the custom domain, so I assume I should get the account plan to have the ability to export the code, is that correct?

To be clear: you’ve got hosting and a domain name with another company, right? That’s where you’re planning on hosting the website you’ve made in webflow?
If that’s correct, then an account plan is all you need. A site plan is like hosting, really.

I’ve just setup Recpatcha on my webflow site, and after checking out pagespeed insights, I’m a bit horrified at the results.
Ideally, I’d like to be able to load the recaptcha js myself once users start click around in the form. Webflow currently adds a script tag that loads recpatcha automatically, and doesn’t allow me to disable this / prevent them from forcing this load.
Is there any way we could add a toggle that would allow us to customize whether or not we would like recaptcha to be loaded automatically? There are several pages with no forms at all, so this feature would be especially useful to remove this unneeded load on this page. This could significantly help to improve pagespeed on a lot of sites.
Thanks!","

No, not within Webflow as ReCaptcha is an all or nothing affair when using that built in feature.  You could opt to use a third party form processor that allows for ReCaptcha on a form by form basis like usebasin.com.",Got it! Thanks.

(how to share your site Read-Only link)","Hello Amy,
This is a very interesting problem. Unfortunately, I think you might need actual webflow support to get this sorted. Although it is interesting that you say it works in incognito mode.
If you haven’t tried yet, a few things I would try are, checking if there are any updates with Chrome, rebooting the computer (since that just resets everything) - if you have any special firewalls/antivirus maybe try turning it off and see if that makes a difference.
Lastly, if you’re on some kind of “secure network” like a University or a business, that could cause things like this to happen - I used to work for the Fed Gov and our secure system was truly .
Anyways, if non of that seems to be the problem, you can get info on how to reach Webflow support in the link below.

I’m trying to post this question in a different way & in a different subtopic.
Say you have a CMS collection that uses different references: e.g. Category, Date, & Author (Just an example) and you want to use a filter integration like mixitup/jetboost etc to allow the user to filter the page.
How would you go about showing ONLY the individual filter items (drop-downs or checkboxes etc)  that were connected (e.g. maybe only 3 out of 5 created categories were associated with the CMS collection).

How can I make the nav bar stand out while still maintaining the essence of the transparent effect?

You could give the text aglow, add a white to transparent gradient within the header container going from top to bottom, add a transparent color within the header container (like your doing now) or you could give the entire background image an overlay of semi-transparent color.
I like where your going now with the solid color only within the naviagtion container, but I feel like you could smooth out the harsh transition a bit by either going with an overlay over the entire background image (maybe like a 10-20% white) or by using a white to transparent gradient instead.",@mikeyevin Thanks for the advice!

(how to share your site Read-Only link)","If you plan on exporting any of your projects to host elsewhere, you should choose the Lite Account plan—which is the first level that offers site export—and then you can have up to 10 unhosted (ex:mysite.webflow.io) projects available in your dashboard at any given time. Once you publish a project with Webflow hosting, it no longer counts towards that account limit.
If you don’t expect to have more than two actively developed projects at any given time and plan to host all of your projects on Webflow, then you can stick with the Free Account plan and add Site plans as needed for your hosted sites.
In addition to code export and 8 additional unpublished projects, the Lite Account plan gives you enhanced staging (with up to 100 static pages and 50 CMS items on your unpublished Webflow projects) and unlimited project transfers which may come in handy as a freelancer.","Thanks for the reply. I guess I’m still unsure what’s right for me and probably need to learn more about the tool. Questions I have are - can I create a design system and use it for multiple sites, client sites. Is this possible if I set the client up with an individual site plan for each project? Or would I need the account plan to do this?

For reference, I’m currently working in sketch/abstract to build component libraries and design pages to hand off to dev. Thanks",You can create elements that can be copied between projects (CTRL/CMD+C & CTRL/CMD+V) but it’s currently not possible to share symbols across multiple projects. Webflow have mentioned on a few occasions that they’re working on that functionality—with some other changes like nesting symbols within symbols and renaming those elements to “components” instead—but there’s no planned release date for that.,"I think for now im narrowing to the basic site plan or the lite account plan. Plan to explore the CMS site plan as needed, for now i dont need it.
Guessing that copying symbols between site plan projects (lets say i set up individual site plans for individual clients and one for myself) would not work.
ok, so if i want to copy symbols between projects, im guessing I would probably need the account plan. Does how ive explained that make sense?
thanks for your insight",rereading all of this I think i am going to end up with the lite account plan.,"The Lite Account plan doesn’t change the base functionality of Webflow, so all the features are the same across each plan—even Free.

Guessing that copying symbols between site plan projects (lets say i set up individual site plans for individual clients and one for myself) would not work.

I’ve actually never tried copying a symbol, however even if it was possible they wouldn’t be “linked” together between projects—this is the functionality coming later. You can break a symbol first, copy the element over to the new project, and then create a symbol from it though.","@Kpduffy777 were you able to figure out what plan to get?

G-suite is an option but there are others like privateemail (a namecheap product), dreamhost has an option as well and protonmail does as well. All these cost about $10-15/year for one address. The issue would be that some providers online include email when you use their wordpress hosting. The above all have a product that’s separate from having to buy website hosting. You might already know this but it’s worth repeating, don’t use a general address with forms (like contact@yourwebsite.com), this will cause errors and get blacklisted by the form. So in your form settings, the address should be yourclientsname@theirwebsite.com."
