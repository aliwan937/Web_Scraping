I’m trying to push form file data to Airtable via Integromat but I couldn’t make it so far.
The problem is Webflow creates an API link for form files and it doesn’t allow somebody to reach that file without login.
I tried to HTTP request for OUTH but I couldn’t make it either. Is there anybody who has faced a similar issue?
I just want to create a job application form and push the CV file to the client’s email.

I’m having major page-trigger interaction lag on all of my pages; after loading, interaction run smoothly. I don’t have plug-ins or heavy assets running on load; all images are compressed using tiny png.

I am a bit confused on what plan I should do, site plan or account plan.
I do have my own hosting, and already have the custom domain, so I assume I should get the account plan to have the ability to export the code, is that correct?
Also, if I go with the account plan, am I limited in the number of pages I can design on the website/project? Do I also need to add a site plan even though I have my own hosting account somewhere else?","@intensero welcome to the forum! In your case, an account plan should be fine. To be clear: you’ve got hosting and a domain name with another company, right? That’s where you’re planning on hosting the website you’ve made in webflow?
If that’s correct, then an account plan is all you need. A site plan is like hosting, really. It allows you to publish a website to a custom domain on webflow’s servers.","Understood, thank you so much @sarahfrison","Hi guys.  I’m building a collection list with projects on display.

(how to share your site Read-Only link)","Hello,
I’ve just setup Recpatcha on my webflow site, and after checking out pagespeed insights, I’m a bit horrified at the results.
Ideally, I’d like to be able to load the recaptcha js myself once users start click around in the form. Webflow currently adds a script tag that loads recpatcha automatically, and doesn’t allow me to disable this / prevent them from forcing this load.
Is there any way we could add a toggle that would allow us to customize whether or not we would like recaptcha to be loaded automatically? There are several pages with no forms at all, so this feature would be especially useful to remove this unneeded load on this page. This could significantly help to improve pagespeed on a lot of sites.
Thanks!","

No, not within Webflow as ReCaptcha is an all or nothing affair when using that built in feature.  You could opt to use a third party form processor that allows for ReCaptcha on a form by form basis like usebasin.com.",Got it! Thanks. Do you know how I could request a feature that would allow this? It would make a big difference for site load time.,"I’m experencing problems with my header navigation links.

(how to share your site Read-Only link)","Hello Amy,
This is a very interesting problem. Unfortunately, I think you might need actual webflow support to get this sorted. Although it is interesting that you say it works in incognito mode.
If you haven’t tried yet, a few things I would try are, checking if there are any updates with Chrome, rebooting the computer (since that just resets everything) - if you have any special firewalls/antivirus maybe try turning it off and see if that makes a difference.
Lastly, if you’re on some kind of “secure network” like a University or a business, that could cause things like this to happen - I used to work for the Fed Gov and our secure system was truly .
Anyways, if non of that seems to be the problem, you can get info on how to reach Webflow support in the link below.

I’m trying to post this question in a different way & in a different subtopic.
Say you have a CMS collection that uses different references: e.g. Category, Date, & Author (Just an example) and you want to use a filter integration like mixitup/jetboost etc to allow the user to filter the page.
How would you go about showing ONLY the individual filter items (drop-downs or checkboxes etc)  that were connected (e.g. maybe only 3 out of 5 created categories were associated with the CMS collection).

I am looking for design tips for my websites navigation. I really like the look of transparent navigation on the top of my page but I have to choose my images incredibly carefully to make it standout/visible/readable. I am going to have close to 700 CMS items when I am up and running so carefully choosing every image is out of the question.
How can I make the nav bar stand out while still maintaining the essence of the transparent effect?

You could give the text aglow, add a white to transparent gradient within the header container going from top to bottom, add a transparent color within the header container (like your doing now) or you could give the entire background image an overlay of semi-transparent color.
I like where your going now with the solid color only within the naviagtion container, but I feel like you could smooth out the harsh transition a bit by either going with an overlay over the entire background image (maybe like a 10-20% white) or by using a white to transparent gradient instead.",@mikeyevin Thanks for the advice!
