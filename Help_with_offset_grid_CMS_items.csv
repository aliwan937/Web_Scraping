How do I hide the login link/button in the menu in webflow on those embedded Knack pages (which will show “logout” in the embedded view when the user is logged in)?
Thanks","Help needed.
I would like to setup my portfolio with CMS however I need to ad more images to different pages projects. When setting up it seems that every page has to be exactly the same and if i ad elements to one page it adds to all.
Some of my projects only have a few images while others have a lot.
If someone could point me in the right direction here that would be most appreciated!

I’m trying to push form file data to Airtable via Integromat but I couldn’t make it so far.
The problem is Webflow creates an API link for form files and it doesn’t allow somebody to reach that file without login.
I tried to HTTP request for OUTH but I couldn’t make it either. Is there anybody who has faced a similar issue?
I just want to create a job application form and push the CV file to the client’s email.
Thanks,
Batuhan","Hi,
I’m having major page-trigger interaction lag on all of my pages; after loading, interaction run smoothly. I don’t have plug-ins or heavy assets running on load; all images are compressed using tiny png.
If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it. It’s sucks because the interactions used to load smooth  and not sure what changed.
Thank you,
Amir

Doing this for 200 videos is a bit tedious so if this is solved, it would be great for future projects.","My webflow site works perfectly on safari but some element shadows and images won’t show on google chrome.
Anyone else experiencing the same issue?

I have figured out MixItUp filtering for the most part, but I’d like to be able to use a switch field for basically “has attribute” “doesn’t have attribute” filtering. Is this possible or am I hosed? At first I was thinking of using the text from a switch field but apparently you can’t print that. Anyone know any other way to do this?",I’d love to get an answer to this question as well. Right now I have a workaround based on using an option field but it would be best if switch fields are directly supported.,"(topic withdrawn by author, will be automatically deleted in 24 hours unless flagged)","Hello, I need to make a website for a client, which has about 7 static pages, no CMS.
I am a bit confused on what plan I should do, site plan or account plan.
I do have my own hosting, and already have the custom domain, so I assume I should get the account plan to have the ability to export the code, is that correct?
Also, if I go with the account plan, am I limited in the number of pages I can design on the website/project? Do I also need to add a site plan even though I have my own hosting account somewhere else?","@intensero welcome to the forum! In your case, an account plan should be fine. To be clear: you’ve got hosting and a domain name with another company, right? That’s where you’re planning on hosting the website you’ve made in webflow?
If that’s correct, then an account plan is all you need. A site plan is like hosting, really. It allows you to publish a website to a custom domain on webflow’s servers.","Understood, thank you so much @sarahfrison","Hi guys.  I’m building a collection list with projects on display. I thought maybe a combo of flex and grids would be the best way, but I wonder what would be the best practice to get vertical offset on the different collection items? See my attached screen from Figma.ofset_cms_item_blocks832×1187 148 KB
I do not think this is a good practice when it comes to user friendliness for the client: Dynamic Grid Item Offset
Any other solution I welcome.
Thanks in advance.
Hope it all made sense
